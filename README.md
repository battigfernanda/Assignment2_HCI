5 new feautures that could be implemented to this app and other simplar apps: 

1. Adaptive Learning Dashboard - this feature would adjust the course material according to a student's performance and keep track of their progress in the classes. If a learner is having trouble understanding a certain idea, the feature may offer more resources, changing the level of difficulty, or instantly recommend peer tutors.

2. Real-Time Language Translation for Lectures - This would be particularly helpful due to the amount of international students at Sheridan College. By enabling students to listen to the lecture in their preferred language via headphones, it would help for better understanding.

3. Mental Health Check-Ins - Install a mental health monitoring system powered by AI that uses the app to check in with kids on a regular basis. It might identify indicators of stress or burnout by doing sentiment analysis on their interactions and output. When assistance was required, the system would connect them with counselling services, recommend breaks, and give resources. This could be more work to implement but it useful and a good idea.

4. Virtual Study Rooms with Focus Tracking - Establish online study spaces where students can collaborate and learn from one another. This feature might have a focus tracking function that uses AI to keep tabs on students' phone use while studying and gently prompt them to return to their studies if they stray. It might also make it possible to establish group goals and standards for study sessions.

5. Dynamic Scheduling Assistant - An AI powered scheduling assistant that helps students organize their classes and assignments while also dynamically adjusting their calendar in response to unanticipated events, such postponed classes, extended deadlines for tasks, or personal situations, guaranteeing effective time management.
